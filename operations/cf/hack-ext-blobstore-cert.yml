# In some cases adding custom certificate will not work due to issue https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/issues/89
# /!\ Cloud controller use fog and excon beside which bundle is own certificates, we can't tweak them. We hack cloud controller ruby to remove certificate check (even set ca-file is not working)
#
# should be use after ops file: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/master/operations/use-external-blobstore.yml
